### About me:
At the moment, I am actively studying Python, more specifically the Django framework, making a website using PostgreSQL databases.  
Wrote an api using DRF for a ToDo site. I have a little git experience. 

With VirtualBox, I used Linux Debian with and without a graphical interface(Terminal).
For a site deployment experience.(nginx, gunicorn, tmux...)

I also tried the Pytest testing framework. (fixture, yield, mark.parametrize..)

In parallel with the JS course I am taking an online course in Automated Testing at EPAM.

Studied development methodologies, TCP/IP, OSI  
I try to constantly learn something new.
